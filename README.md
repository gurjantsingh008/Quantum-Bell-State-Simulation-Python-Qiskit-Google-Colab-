# Quantum Bell State Simulation

This repository contains a simple quantum computing project that simulates a Bell state using Qiskit on Google Colab. The project was developed as a self-directed learning exercise through tutorials.

## Description
- Simulated a Bell state quantum circuit to demonstrate quantum entanglement.
- Utilized Hadamard and CNOT gates, with AerSimulator producing a histogram of 488 '00' and 512 '11' outcomes from 1000 shots.
- Explores foundational quantum computing concepts and cloud-based simulation techniques.

## Files
- `Quantum_Bell_State_Simulation.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook with the Qiskit code and visualization.

## How to Run
1. Open the `.ipynb` file in Google Colab (colab.research.google.com).
2. Run the first cell to install Qiskit: `!pip install qiskit qiskit-aer`.
3. Execute the subsequent cells to simulate the circuit and view the histogram.

## Prerequisites
- Internet access.
- A Google account for Colab (free).

## Notes
- The project showcases basic quantum entanglement, a key concept in quantum communication.
- Learned through self-directed tutorials, making it ideal for beginners in quantum computing.
